# Multicylce-pipelined-RISC-processor
This project designs and implements a MIPS processor in Verilog HDL with a 5-stage pipeline (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB). It supports R, I, and J instructions, load/store (lw, sw), branch (beq), and jump (j). Forwarding and hazard detection units manage data/control hazards, enabling correct execution with dependencies and hazards.
